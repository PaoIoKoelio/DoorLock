# DoorLock
A Smart Door Lock System that allows users to lock and unlock a door remotely using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk app. The system also provides real-time feedback on the door's status (open or closed) using a magnetic sensor. An email is sent to the user whenever the door opens. A servo motor is used to pull a latch that locks the door.
